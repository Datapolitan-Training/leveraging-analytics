# Exercise - Reducing Noise Complaints in NYC

+ Between 1 Jan and 30 Sept 2017, there were an average of 1,271 noise-related 311 service requests a day
+ The same period in 2016 had an average of 1,180 noise-related 311 service requests a day
+ You've been tasked with decreasing noise complaints in the city
+ .red[What questions would you ask to kick off a data analysis?]

![img-center-40](images/ideate_discuss_decide_horiz_crop.png)

???

+ A facilitated group ideation exercise to get them thinking about key questions and problems
+ Task to participants: (1) take 5 minutes to come up with your own questions and be prepared to share with the group (2) take 5 minutes and discuss with your partner (3) discuss the questions as a group
+ Facilitator helps scope an analytical question that will be developed throughout the morning lecture session
+ Group should have written down a series of questions to be discussed

+ Identify the outcome

---

# Outcomes vs Outputs
--

+ Outcomes are the larger benefits and/or achievements you're trying to realize<br>
--
 (happiness, health, well-being, etc.)
--

+ Outputs are the tangible parts of your outcome<br>
--
 (survey responses, measured results, etc.)
--

+ Outputs enable us to find outcomes
--

+ Without outcomes, there is no need for outputs
